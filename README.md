# CivicTask

We can send the order of execution of tasks in our API call in JSON format, 

Each key-value will indicate the attributes and type of task

for example we are using numbers here 1 means access missing values! 2 means identify duplicate rows! 

We will generalize this by creating a python script which will take 2 inputs 

first number which is kind of task, second is attributes for the task! 

we will verify the input attributes and process accordingly

In this way you can add more tasks!
